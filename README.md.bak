# Omnitrix

# Work in Progress  

This project is meant to be the omnitrix from the Ben 10 Classic series as accurate as posible. It uses a ESP32 Development Board - NodeMCU-32S2 module, a Round LCD Display GC9A01, a Fermion DFPlayer Pro for sound, a Rotary Encoder 12mm 24P/R with Switch and a tack switch.
(The Rotary Encoder is planned to be changed by Mini Switches for space saving. Also RGB LEDs and battery will to be added) Arduino IDE is used for the software part of the project but could be changed for ESP-IDF in order to use the ULP Coprocessor.  

Scematic images will be added shortly  

This is a first test of the project with most of the features included:

# Current Features:  
Array of PNG images decoded into HEX representing the first twelve aliens  
Animation  
Sound (commented for now)  
Ability to go into Deep Sleep Mode after a short time of inactivity (tranformed mode in progress)  
  

# To Do List: ✅ ☐  
	☐ Use Mini switches instead of Encoder  
	☐ Fix transformation time in Deep Sleep mode  
	✅ Update ShowSelectSymbols and ShowSymbols with PNGdec  
	✅ Power reduction code  
		☐ Increase resistance of voltage dividers  
		☐ Only enable GPIO outputs at the last moment  
		☐ Remove all Serial.println  
	☐ Power reduction code for LCD display  
	☐ GPIO pins as Vcc for inputs to reduce energy when in Deep Sleep  
	☐ RGB LEDs  
	☐ Conect 6V battery with switch in 5V pin  
	
Future Plans:  
	☐ Secret combination for Master Control Mode  
	☐ Add more interrupts for Deep Sleep  
	☐ Menu  
	☐	Show time  
	☐	Show battery state  
	☐	Sound options  
	☐	Change tranformation Time variables  
	☐	Go to Demo Mode  
	☐ Smoother animation  
	☐ Xtra animation  
	☐ Update code with FOTA  
	☐ Download aliens from a server
